Greetings, agent. Apologies for calling you in on such short notice, but we've got a situation here. One of our finest operatives, codenamed Agent Sparrow, didn't make her scheduled rendevous last night.
It was the first such check-in in one month, so she could be anywhere. That's where you come in. We need to keep a low profile, so you'll be using the Fly Spy to enter Sparrow's home and look for clues.
You need to find clues to answer several questions about her field name, what happened to her, and who's involved. You'll be able to read more about the case requirements while you're on your mission.
You'll be navigating this mission using a text interface - no mouse required. Just like now! Are you ready? If so, type 'ready'. If not, type 'repeat' to hear this all from the top. I'm expecting good things from you, agent. Report back ASAP.
You climb into the Fly Spy - a shrinkable drone meant to carry one field agent.
The Fly Spy shrinks down, readying you for your mission.
Shrunk down and ready to investigate, your handler drops you off. You head for Sparrow's open window.
Welcome back, agent. I'm hoping you have all the answers we need to get Agent Sparrow back.
If you aren't ready, you can type 'back' at any point to go back to the investigation.
First thing's first: what name is Agent Sparrow using in the field? Type her full name, first and last.
